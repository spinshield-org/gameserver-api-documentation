#  Backoffice
Within backoffice you can find all balance transactions, players, available games, manage free spins but more importantly also configure the API configuration.

Backoffice URL will be provided to you including your login. Keep these details private as it gives power to change API configuration.

## Overview
Within overview you can check your current balance, which is applicable to you if you have a GGR% based contract. The balance controls the due amount you can have in current billing cycle, per example if you have 1,000$ balance your current bill can not exceed 1,500$ before being disabled.

## Callback Log
Per request, we can temporarily turn on complete callback logging. This feature will invoke a lot of extra callbacks hence why this feature manually needs to be turned on for your API key.
