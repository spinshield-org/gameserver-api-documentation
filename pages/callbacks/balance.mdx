# Callback Action: balance
This callback will be sent to your callback URL, specified within the [backoffice](/2-backoffice). We will send this callback at start of game. You should always return balance on integer format.

The call_id is a unique id sent with each callback and can be considered the transaction id.

## Requests
Requests are sent as `GET` to your callback url, specified on your API key.
