# Callback Validation
Each callback sent includes `key` variable and `timestamp` variable. This makes you able to verify the origin of the callback is coming from us.

The key is constructed by the `timestamp` variable + salt_key. The salt key is unique and specific per API key, you can set new salt key in the [backoffice](/2-backoffice).

The key is constructed as following:

### Key Construct (Javascript)
```js
md5($timestamp + $saltkey);
```

### Key Construct (PHP)
```php
md5($timestamp.$saltkey);
```

To validate the signature, simply create the signature then check if it is the same as the `key` variable sent on the callback.

If the signature does not match return response:
```json
  {
    "error": 2,
    "balance": 0
  }
```
