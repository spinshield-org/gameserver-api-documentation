# Callback Action: debit/credit
Depending on the callback action you should credit/debit your player's balance for the `amount` given on callback. 

If player does not have enough balance on debit action, you should return the insufficient balance response (error: 1) like shown below.

The call_id is a unique id sent with each callback and can be considered the transaction id.

## Important note
You should allow `credit` action and `debit` action independently of each other.

There are cases where a `credit` callback can be sent without first sending a `debit` callback, per example in case of rollback/refund system activated.

In some game providers there may be occurances where new `round_id` is made on each game action, for example when bonus game won on some providers this might be sent as individual game rounds and will thus only send `credit` action. 

This may also affect `gameplay_final` in particular cases.

Requests are sent as `GET` to your callback url, specified on your API key.
