# Callback Action: debit/credit
Depending on the callback action you should credit/debit your player's balance for the `amount` given on callback. 

If player does not have enough balance on `debit` action, you should return the insufficient balance response (error: 1) like shown below.

The call_id is a unique id sent with each callback and can be considered the transaction id.

## Important note
You should allow `credit` action and `debit` action independently of each other.

There are rare cases where a `credit` callback can be sent without first sending a `debit` callback, per example in case of rollback/refund system activated.
In this case if you need tie it to a `debit` action, simply look up the most recent `debit` transaction in your system for the specific player, game & currency and attach the `credit` to that round.

In some game providers there may be rare occurances where new `round_id` is made on each game action.
For example when bonus game won subsequent spins within the bonus game on some providers might be sent as individual unique game round_id's and will thus only send `credit` action.

This may also affect `gameplay_final` in rare cases.

## Rollbacks
Any rollback events, which can both be `debit` or `credit` action will be marked under the `rb` variable on our callbacks.

When this variable is `1` it means the sent action is a rollback. The original round_id should be included and you should proceed to either `debit` or `credit` the player's balance like you would on a regular callback.

## Requests
Requests are sent as `GET` to your callback url, which is specified on your API key configuration.
