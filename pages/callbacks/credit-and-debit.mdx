# Callback Action: debit/credit
Depending on the callback action you should credit/debit your player's balance for the `amount` given on callback. 

If player does not have enough balance on debit action, you should return the insufficient balance response (error: 1) like shown below.

The call_id is a unique id sent with each callback and can be considered the transaction id.

## Important note
There are cases where a credit can be sent with prior debit, in case of rollback/refund system activated we will send a `credit` action without prior `debit`. 

Also in some game providers there may be occurances where new `round_id` is made for each consecutive action on the slotmachine, for example when bonus game won on some providers this might be sent up as individual game rounds and only send `credit` actions. 

In such case you can add those won amounts, to the last debit transaction recorded within your system for specific player & game.

Requests are sent as `GET` to your callback url, specified on your API key.
