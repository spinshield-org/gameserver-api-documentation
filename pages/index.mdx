#  Getting Started

## Seamless Wallet
We make use of the `seamless wallet` principal. This means that you control the player's balance/funds completely. 

We simply let you know what happens on the game and inform you of each game action.

## PHP Client
If you are using PHP on your project, we have a composer package available to assist you with integrating our games API.

For more details check the [package on github](https://github.com/spinshield/spinclient) or run `composer require spinshield/spinclient` to get started.

## API Methods
When you send requests to our game server, this should be `POST` request and include JSON body content.

Your JSON body content should always include your `api_login` and your `api_password`, these details can be found within the [backoffice](/2-backoffice).

```json
{
  "api_login" : "d13b1ceb-6209-4163-b1cf-f304c28b81ec",
  "api_password": "dqRin2nfLosij2n88",
  ...
}
```

## Callback Communication
Our game server sends `GET` requests to your callback URL and always expects a JSON response that includes error code and player balance. If player balance can not be retrieved for whatever reason, you should return `0` as balance.

All balance must be returned as integer and in cents, that means if your player's balance is `2.50$` this should be returned as `250`.

### Succesful Response
```json
  {
    "error": 0,
    "balance": 250
  }
```

### Insufficient Balance Response
```json
  {
    "error": 1,
    "balance": 250
  }
```

### Processing Error (for example player not found or invalid signature)
```json
  {
    "error": 2,
    "balance": 0
  }
```
